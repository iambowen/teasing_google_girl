调戏谷歌娘

Fetching voice by google translation service and transfer it to mp3 files. Presumably support different languages including chinese.

Example runs like this:

      ./teasing.sh example(filename) en(language)  "hello wolrd"(text)
      ./teasing.sh example(filename) zh-cn(language)  "你好"(text)

And laterly you can get example.mp3 under ./tmp directory
